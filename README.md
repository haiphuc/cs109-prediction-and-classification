# cs109_prediction_and_classification
This served as homework for the [CS109 Data Science cource](http://cs109.org) and was represented as a [Jupyter Notebook](HW3.ipynb).

First: I will use data from before 2002 in the Sean Lahman's Baseball Database to create a metric for picking baseball players using linear regression.

Second: I will use the famous iris data set to perform a  k-neareast neighbor classification using cross validation.

Third: I will investigate the influence of higher dimensional spaces on the classification using another standard data set in machine learning called the The digits data set.
